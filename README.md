Greetings fellow devs, Muayed Jihad's here, how's it goin'?

Me? I am an Electrical Engineer, a Math Teacher & tutor, and a couple more things than needn't be discussed at length here.  
I've always been fascinated by `code` and the backend part of our daily used UIs, and here I am finally delving into this world at long last. Hore's to hoping this is the start of a great and blessed endeavor.  
**P.S.** My favorite web browser is [MS Edge](https://duckduckgo.com "The best Chromium browser that isn't chrome ^^").

**Intro to a *good* developer's mindset**    
Code complexity is a monster haunting every developer as they go on with their projects.

Showing off is **NEVER** the point of a useful code.  
A good code is both *simple* and *helpful*.  
>***Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. —Leonardo da Vinci***

A design that wastes developers' efforts on just making the software work is a death sentence for a project in the long run.   
Ultimately, a code should be *easy for its developer and helpfel for others*. And so, one needs to understand their work and the purpose of their code beforehand in order to avoid unnecessary misunderstanding.  


- So, how could you avoid being a victim of complexity?  
1. Know your software; purpose definition.  
2. Be simple.  
3. Question and evaluate any and all change requests based on your software purpose.  
    >- Your instinct as a developer should be resistance to **unnecessary change**. 
  

**D=V/E**  

> The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the change. – *Code Simplicity*
